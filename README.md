Game Demo called Park Guardian created for CS4483 Game Design Course

"Park Guardian is a 2D atmospheric exploration game with a compelling story about the daily adventures of a park ranger. Players will be exposed to a combination of RPG, open world, mystery, and adventure elements that when combined together make Park Guardian a truly unique experience."

"In Park Guardian, players will take control of a Pandora Parkâ€™s newest park ranger as they learn how to navigate the daily responsibilities of their new job. Each in-game day, players will be assigned a list of short tasks to complete but will be given the rest of the day to explore the park to its fullest. Although players may find it easy to adjust to the park ranger lifestyle, they will soon learn that there is more to Pandora Park than meets the eye."
